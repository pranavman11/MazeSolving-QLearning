# Maze Solving Agent

Given a maze find a solution of the maze to traverse the maze and find a path from the start to the given destination
The maze is taken as a NumPy array and the agent was trained using reinforcement learning (penaulty-based system)
The Agent traverses the maze many times and the agent records its learning  the form of penalty and reward for each cell.

Left: Initial maze

Right: Agent learning & finding the optimal path to solve the maze
